# CatchNemo-QuizGame

This is a game I developed as DSA course project in C++ but I've reprogrammed it in Python to make it more efficient and reduced 1800 lines of c++ code into 250 lines of Python code. I've implemented Queues using LinkedList to store the questions I extract from the text file. You can see the c++ code in the following oldsource.cpp file and the new python code in source.py file
